# Data & ML Interface

A **Streamlit** application designed to empower non-programmers to explore datasets, visualize features, and train machine learning models (classification, regression, clustering) without writing a single line of code.

---

## Features

- **ðŸ“‚ Data Upload**: Supports CSV, Excel, and TSV file formats.
- **ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and preprocess data easily.
- **ðŸ“Š Data Analysis**: Generate statistical summaries and visualize data with histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots.
- **ðŸ¤– Machine Learning**:
  - Train models for **classification**, **regression**, and **clustering**.
  - Supported algorithms include Linear Regression, SGD Regressor, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and K-Means.
- **ðŸ“ˆ Model Evaluation**: Analyze model performance with metrics like MSE, RÂ², and confusion matrices.
- **ðŸ“¥ Downloadable Results**: Save generated plots and analysis results.
